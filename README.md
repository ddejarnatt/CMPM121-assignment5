# CMPM121-assignment5
Assignment 5 for CMPM 121
CONTROLS:
WASD - movement (A and D rotate instead of just left/right movement)
QE - secondary rotate (not really needed due to AD rotating, but they're here anyway)

Store Assets:
Player Animations are from Standard Assests from the Unity Store, but the model is mine
